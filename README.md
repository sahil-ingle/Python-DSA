# Python Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my collection of Python implementations for fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository serves as a personal reference and learning resource, aiming to provide clear and efficient code examples for various DSA concepts.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

* **`Array-Based Data Structures/`**: Implementations of array-based structures like stacks, queues, and heaps.
* **`Linked List/`**: Code for singly and doubly linked lists, along with associated operations.
* **`Searching Algorithms/`**: Includes linear and binary search algorithms.
* **`Sorting Algorithms/`**: Features common sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
* **`Trees/`**: Contains implementations for binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal techniques.

Each directory includes Python scripts demonstrating the implementation and usage of these data structures and algorithms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin exploring or contributing:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahil-ingle/Python-DSA.git
   cd Python-DSA
   ```

2. **Explore the Code**:

   Navigate through the directories to view the implementation files. Each script is self-contained with examples and comments to facilitate understanding.

3. **Run the Examples**:

   For instance, to test a sorting algorithm:

   ```bash
   python Sorting_Algorithms/bubble_sort.py
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

A basic test script, `test.py`, is included to verify the functionality of the implementations. You can run it to ensure that all components are working as expected:

```bash
python test.py
```

Feel free to expand upon this script to include additional test cases or to integrate with testing frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest`.
