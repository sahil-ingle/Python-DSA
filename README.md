# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python. The code provided here serves as a reference and learning resource for those interested in understanding and implementing fundamental concepts in DSA using Python.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `Array-based Data Structures`: Contains implementations of array-based data structures such as stacks, queues, heaps, and dynamic arrays.

- `Linked List`: Includes implementations of different types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

- `Trees`: Provides code for various types of trees, such as binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, B-trees, and more.

- `Graphs`: Contains code related to graph data structures and algorithms, including adjacency matrix, adjacency list, graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), and graph algorithms (Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm).

- `Sorting Algorithms`: Includes implementations of different sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort, heapsort, etc.

- `Searching Algorithms`: Provides code for various searching algorithms such as linear search, binary search, interpolation search, and others.

- `Dynamic Programming`: Contains implementations of algorithms and solutions using dynamic programming techniques.

- `Miscellaneous`: Contains utility functions, common algorithms, or miscellaneous data structures that don't fit into any specific category.

## Getting Started

To use the code in this repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sahil-ingle/Python-DSA/
```

Each directory contains Python files (.py) for the respective data structures or algorithms. You can explore the code and run it using a Python interpreter or IDE of your choice.
