# DSA in Python Repository Documentation

The "DSA in Python" repository is a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in the Python programming language. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `README.md`: The main documentation file providing an overview of the repository and instructions on getting started.
- `data_structures/`: A directory containing Python implementations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- `algorithms/`: A directory containing Python implementations of various algorithms including sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the "DSA in Python" repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-in-python.git
   ```

2. Install Python (if not already installed) to run the code snippets.

3. Explore the `data_structures/` and `algorithms/` directories to find the implementations of various data structures and algorithms. Each file contains a Python class or function implementing a specific data structure or algorithm along with comments explaining its usage and time complexities.

4. Use the code snippets in your own projects, modify them as needed, or study them to understand how different data structures and algorithms work.

## Contributing

Contributions to the "DSA in Python" repository are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

3. Make the desired changes to the code or documentation.

4. Test your changes to ensure they are functioning correctly.

5. Commit your changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add my feature"
   ```

6. Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```
   git push origin my-feature
   ```

7. Open a pull request in the main repository. Provide a clear description of your changes, the motivation behind them, and any relevant information.

8. Your pull request will be reviewed by the repository maintainers, and once approved, it will be merged into the main branch.

This concludes the documentation for the "DSA in Python" repository. Enjoy exploring the data structures and algorithms implemented in Python!
